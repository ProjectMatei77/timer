Overview
This is a simple Pomodoro Timer application built using Python's tkinter library. 
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. 
This application helps you manage your work and break times effectively.

Features:

    Work Interval: 25 minutes of focused work.
    
    Short Break: 5 minutes break after each work interval.
    
    Long Break: 20 minutes break after completing 4 work intervals.
    
    Start Button: Starts the timer.
    
    Reset Button: Resets the timer to the initial state.
    
    Visual Feedback: Displays checkmarks for completed work intervals.

How to Use:


    Start the Timer: Click the "Start" button to begin the Pomodoro timer.
    
    Work Session: The timer will count down from 25 minutes. Focus on your work during this time.
    
    Short Break: After the work session, a 5-minute break will start.
    
    Long Break: After completing 4 work sessions, a longer 20-minute break will start.
    
    Reset the Timer: Click the "Reset" button to stop the timer and reset it to the initial state.
